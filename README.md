# conception-of-a-datawarehouse-for-project-management-analysis
This project consisted of the conception of a datawarehouse, starting from raw heterogeneous data ( an excel file, a database, a json file as well as a csv file). The purpose of this datawarehouse is to provide insights on some project management related KPIs such as budget adherence and days overdue. 

Technologies used: 
-Wamp Server ( phpMyAdmin ) 
-Talend Open Studio for Data Integration
-Pentaho Schema Workbench 
-Power BI 

The raw data collected is purely fictitious and intended for demonstration purposes only.
The star schema is included in the repository. 

You can find in the repository a detailed french documentation that provides clear explanations and the different steps ( including the ETL workflow ) leading to the power bi visualizations displayed starting from page 33.
